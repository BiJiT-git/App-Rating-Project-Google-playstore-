# App-Rating-Project-Google-playstore-
Data Analysis on Playstore App rating using python
We analyzed the Data in “googleplaystore.csv” through python to create a prediction model for Google play store team. This involved firstly cleaning different parameters of the Dataset, removing different unwanted symbols, converting some fields into same measurement scales. 

Then we performed Univariate and Bivariate analysis to gather more in depth analytical points for our modelling after that we split the data into training and testing set to test our model and finally we got the R2 score.
